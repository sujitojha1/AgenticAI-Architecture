# AgenticAI-Architecture
Exploring agentic AI architectures

Add these features to your agent [1000]:

Explain the Changes in Architecture from the last one in detail. Must be in the README.md file
If a tool fails, add "Human-In-Loop" and let him answer that part. 
If a plan fails, then add "Human-In-Loop" and suggest a plan, and show the Agent listens
Enforce Max_Steps = 3, and Max_Retries = 3
Write a simulator that runs 100+ Tests. Please add "sleep,"  or else Google will ban you.
Save a tool_performance log, and feed it to Agent (for this, you need to run multiple tools multiple times)
Must be submitted alone, and within a week (else by default you're attempting the OR below).
OR [10000]:

Use the concepts as described in the session today and write your own architecture [10000] as described in this image:

You can use the MCP/Executor code from the code shared, but all Agentic Code must be yours. 
By default, Code Similarity Comparison would be run on your code and code shared, and code matching more than 50% would be disqualified.
You're allowed to form your own groups.
Extended Submission of 2 weeks. 
You're submitting YouTube explanation of your Architecture and GitHub link
